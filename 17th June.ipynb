The key difference between them lies in their level of specificity and the control they provide over which exceptions are caught and how they are handled.\n",

    "g. ValueError\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "a. `EOFError` (End of File Error): An `EOFError` is raised when an input operation reaches the end of a file (or input stream) unexpectedly. This typically happens when you are reading data from a file or standard input and you try to read more data than is available, or you reach the end of the file unexpectedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. `FloatingPointError`: A `FloatingPointError` is raised when an error occurs during a floating-point operation. This can happen when you perform invalid floating-point operations, such as dividing by zero or encountering an undefined result in a mathematical operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. `IndexError`: An `IndexError` is raised when you try to access an index of a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, or string) that is out of range. This typically occurs when you attempt to access an element using an index that is greater than or less than the valid index range of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. `MemoryError`: A `MemoryError` is raised when the Python interpreter runs out of memory while trying to allocate an object or perform some memory-intensive operation. This error can occur when your program consumes too much memory, and the system cannot allocate more memory for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "e. `OverflowError`: An `OverflowError` is raised when a numeric operation exceeds the limits of the data type. This occurs when you try to store a value that is too large for the data type you are using, such as trying to represent a number beyond the maximum value that can be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "f. `TabError`: A `TabError` is raised when there is an issue with the indentation in your Python code. This typically happens when you mix tabs and spaces for indentation, and Python cannot determine the correct indentation level.\n",
    "\n",
    "g. `ValueError`: A `ValueError` is raised when you try to perform an operation on a value of the correct data type, but the value itself is not appropriate for that operation. For example, trying to convert a non-numeric string to an integer using `int()` would raise a `ValueError`."
