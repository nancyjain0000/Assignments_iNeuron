    "**Anonymous vs. Named**: Lambda functions are anonymous, meaning they don't have a name. Regular functions, defined with the def keyword, have a name.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limited Functionality**: Lambda functions are limited in functionality compared to regular functions. They are designed for simple, one-liner operations. Regular functions can have multiple statements, loops, conditions, and more complex logic.\n",

    "**Single Expression**: Lambda functions can only contain a single expression, which is evaluated and returned. Regular functions can have multiple statements and a return statement with multiple return points.\n",

    "**No Documentation Strings**: Lambda functions cannot have docstrings (the multi-line string usually used for documentation) like regular functions can.\n",

    "4. What are the advantages and limitations of lambda functions compared to regular functions in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Lambda functions in Python have their own advantages and limitations when compared to regular functions defined using the `def` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Lambda Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conciseness**: Lambda functions are concise and allow you to define small, simple functions in a single line of code, making your code more readable and reducing verbosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Readability**: In some cases, lambda functions can enhance code readability, especially when used in conjunction with higher-order functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No Need for Naming**: You don't need to assign a name to a lambda function, which can be beneficial when you only use the function in one place and don't want to clutter the namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Functional Programming**: Lambda functions are a natural fit for functional programming constructs, enabling you to write more functional-style code.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Inline Usage**: Lambda functions can be used inline within expressions, making them convenient for quick and short operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations of Lambda Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Limited Complexity**: Lambda functions are limited to a single expression, which means you can't include multiple statements or complex logic within them. Regular functions can contain multiple statements and have more flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No Documentation Strings**: Lambda functions cannot have docstrings, which are typically used to provide documentation for functions. Regular functions can include docstrings to explain their purpose and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Limited Reusability**: Lambda functions are less reusable than regular functions because they lack a name and can only be used in the context where they are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Readability Concerns**: While lambda functions can improve code readability in some cases, they can also hinder it when used for complex operations. Using a named function with a clear name and a docstring is often more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scope Clarity**: If a lambda function captures variables from an enclosing scope, it can sometimes make the code less clear, as it's not immediately obvious where those variables come from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are useful for simple, short, and one-off operations, especially in functional programming contexts. Regular functions are more versatile, offer better code organization and reusability, and are a better choice when you need to define complex logic or include documentation. The choice between lambda functions and regular functions depends on the specific use case and the trade-offs between conciseness and clarity."
