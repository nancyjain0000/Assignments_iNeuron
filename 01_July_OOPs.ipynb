    "1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to model real-world entities and their interactions in a software system. \n",
    "\n",
    "It aims to organize code into reusable and modular structures called classes and objects, promoting concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to make it easier to design, understand, and maintain complex software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is an object in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: In Python, an object is a fundamental concept representing a real-world entity or data structure. Objects are instances of classes and can store both data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in Python, including integers, lists, and custom-defined classes, is an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is a class in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: A class in Python is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects. A class can have attributes (variables) to store data and methods (functions) to perform actions related to those attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are defined using the `class` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are attributes and methods in a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Attributes in a class are variables that store data related to the class or its instances. They are characteristics or properties of objects created from the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are functions defined within a class that can perform actions or operations on the class's attributes or on the instance itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the difference between class variables and instance variables in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The difference between class variables and instance variables in Python lies in their scope and usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Class variables: These variables are shared among all instances of a class. They are defined at the class level and are the same for every object created from that class. Class variables are useful for storing data that is common to all instances. You define them within the class, outside of any instance methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Instance variables: These variables are unique to each instance of a class. They are defined within the class's methods, typically within the `__init__` method, using the `self` keyword. Instance variables hold data specific to an individual object.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This 'self' keyword can be any other name, but we prefer a standard one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The `self` parameter in Python class methods refers to the instance of the class itself. It is the conventional name used for this parameter, but you could technically use any name you like, although using `self` is a widely followed convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "   When you call a method on an instance of a class, Python automatically passes the instance itself as the first argument to the method. This allows you to access and manipulate the instance's attributes and perform actions that are specific to that instance. In other words, `self` is a reference to the object on which the method is called, allowing you to work with the object's data and behavior within the method."
