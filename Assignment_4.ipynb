    "\n",
    "Answer: In Python, variables that \"contain\" list values, or more accurately, reference list values, do not actually store the list data itself. Instead, they contain references or pointers to the memory location where the list data is stored. This concept applies not only to lists but also to most other mutable data types, including dictionaries and custom objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the code mentioned below creates a list and assigns it to the variable my_list:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",

    "The variable my_list does not contain the list data itself. Instead, it contains a reference to the location where the list data is stored in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we access the value of my_list, Python follows the reference to the location where the list data is stored and returns the list data. It simply means that we can modify the list data without changing the variable that contains the reference to the list.\n",
