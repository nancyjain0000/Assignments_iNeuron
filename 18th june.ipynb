    "\n",
    "Answer: Yes, a try-except block can be nested inside another try-except block. This allows you to handle different levels of exceptions with different error-handling strategies. The inner try-except block can catch exceptions that are specific to a particular portion of code, while the outer try-except block can catch more general exceptions or provide a broader level of error handling.

    "5. What is logging in Python, and why is it important in software development?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Logging in Python refers to the process of recording information, messages, and events that occur during the execution of a software program. This information is typically stored in log files or other output destinations like the console. The Python standard library includes a powerful and flexible logging module, which provides a standardized way to incorporate logging into your Python applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging is important in software development for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Debugging and Troubleshooting:** During development and in production, software can encounter various issues, such as errors, exceptions, and unexpected behavior. Logging allows developers and system administrators to trace the execution flow of a program and identify the root causes of issues. Log messages provide valuable context and information about what happened and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Monitoring and Analysis:** In production environments, logs are a critical tool for monitoring the health and performance of an application. By analyzing log data, you can gain insights into system behavior, identify performance bottlenecks, and detect security threats or anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Auditing and Compliance:** In some industries and applications, there are legal or regulatory requirements to maintain detailed logs of system activities. Logging helps in creating an audit trail that demonstrates compliance with these requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Communication:** Logs can facilitate communication and collaboration among team members. Developers can share log files with colleagues to help diagnose issues, and system administrators can use logs to communicate system status and issues with developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Explain the purpose of log levels in Python logging and provide examples of when each log level would be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Log levels in Python logging serve to categorize and prioritize log messages based on their severity. These levels allow developers to control which types of messages are recorded and to filter logs according to their importance. Python's logging module defines several standard log levels, each with a specific purpose. \n",
    "\n",

    "7. What are log formatters in Python logging, and how can you customise the log message format using formatters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Log formatters in Python logging are objects responsible for specifying the layout and structure of log messages. They allow you to control how log messages are presented in the log output, including the content, order, and formatting of various log components like timestamps, log levels, logger names, and the actual log message. Python's logging module provides a flexible way to customize log message formats using formatters.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create and customize log message formats using formatters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Built-in Formatters:**\n",
    "   Python's logging module comes with some built-in formatters that you can use. These include:\n",
    "   - `logging.Formatter.default`: A basic formatter that includes timestamp, log level, and log message.\n",
    "   - `logging.Formatter.simple`: A formatter that only includes the log message.\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can use these built-in formatters when configuring your log handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Custom Formatters:**\n",
    "   If you want to create a custom log message format, you can define your own formatter by subclassing the `logging.Formatter` class. To create a custom formatter, you need to implement the `format` method, which takes a log record as its argument and returns a formatted string.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Formatting Options:**\n",
    "   You can use various placeholders within the format string passed to your custom formatter. Some commonly used placeholders include:\n",
    "   - `%(asctime)s`: The timestamp when the log record was created.\n",
    "   - `%(levelname)s`: The log level (e.g., INFO, WARNING).\n",
    "   - `%(name)s`: The logger's name.\n",
    "   - `%(message)s`: The actual log message.\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can customize the format string to include these placeholders in the order and format you desire.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Setting Formatters for Handlers:**\n",
    "   After creating a custom formatter, you can associate it with a log handler using the `setFormatter` method. This way, the formatter will be used to format log messages that pass through that handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "By customizing log message formats using formatters, you can tailor the appearance of your log output to meet your specific needs. This allows you to present log information in a way that makes it easier to read, understand, and analyze, whether for debugging during development or for monitoring in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How can you set up logging to capture log messages from multiple modules or classes in a Python application?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Setting up logging to capture log messages from multiple modules or classes in a Python application involves configuring a centralized logging system and ensuring that all parts of your code use the same logging configuration. \n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to collect and manage log messages from various modules or classes in a consistent and organized manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is the difference between the logging and print statements in Python? When should you use logging over print statements in a real-world application?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Logging and print statements in Python serve different purposes, and they are used in different contexts within a real-world application. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logging:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Purpose:** Logging is primarily used for recording information about the execution of a program, such as messages, warnings, errors, and other events. It is a systematic way to document what happens during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Destination:** Log messages are typically written to log files or other designated output destinations (e.g., console, network, syslog) rather than being displayed directly to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Levels:** Logging provides different log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to categorize the severity of messages. This allows you to filter and control the amount of information captured in logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flexibility:** Logging allows you to customize the log message format, set log levels, configure multiple log handlers, and route log messages to different destinations based on their severity or source.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Control:** Logging is controllable and configurable at runtime. You can change the log level or destination without modifying the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Print Statements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Purpose:** Print statements are used for displaying information directly to the console during program execution. They are primarily for debugging and providing immediate feedback to developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Destination:** Print statements output to the console, and the messages are typically visible only during the current run of the program. They are not meant for long-term documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Levels:** Print statements do not have different levels of severity like logging. All print statements are treated equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Format:** The format of print statements is simple, and they do not offer the same level of customization and structure as log messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Permanence:** Print statements are not easily controlled or configured at runtime. To remove or change print statements, you must modify the code and redeploy the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "While print statements are useful for quick debugging and immediate feedback during development, logging is the preferred choice for recording, categorizing, and controlling log messages in real-world applications. Logging provides more structure, flexibility, and control over the logging process, making it a valuable tool for monitoring, debugging, and maintaining software in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Write a Python program that logs a message to a file named \"app.log\" with the\n",
    "following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "● The log message should be \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "● The log level should be set to \"INFO.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "● The log file should append new log entries without overwriting previous ones."
